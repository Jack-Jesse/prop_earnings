# Learning Journal - Week 4

## Learning Activities & Resources
1. **Learning Resource:** My learning activities and resources for setting up a local server for Joomla on my mac using vagrant and CognacBox i began by researching the requirements for Vagrant and how to install it and use it. I researched a replacement for ScotchBox because it was out of date and did not work on Joomla 5. I found CognacBox and installed Vagrant and CognacBox, a pre-configured Vagrant box tailored for web development.

2. **Learning Activity:** I read through some documentation to understand the basics of vagrant. I then read through some Joomla documentation to gain a quick understanding of how to use it. I had to read through some information about CognacBox to understand how to install it and get it working.
   - **Insight:** Flexibility and Customization: I have learned that Joomla is known for being more flexible with customisation. This flexibility and customization make it a powerful CMS for websites with complex content management needs.
   - **Insight:** Transferable skills: By learning another CMS (Joomla) before WordPress, it gives me some skills and knowledge that I can apply to another CMS (WordPress).

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights
Gaining skills in Joomla, a popular content management system, equips me with versatile web development capabilities. This broadens my skill set, making me more employable across various industries. The ability to manage and customize websites efficiently is highly valued in the tech industry. Setting up and managing local server environments is an important aspect of web development. This skill is beneficial for creating and testing websites before they go live, but it is also beneficial for understanding the differences between local and production environments. This knowledge is good for issues that arise in production and ensuring that web apps are deployed smoothly.
