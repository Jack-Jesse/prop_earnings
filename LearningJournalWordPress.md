# Learning Journal - Week 3

## Learning Activities & Resources
1. **Learning Resource:** For this practical, I decide to rely less on external resources. My approach was to go straight to working on the WordPress CMS, where I felt pretty comfortable working because it looked pretty straight forward after having prior experience with a CMS like Joomla. Following this. Subsequently, I utilized the documentation and resources provided by AWS Lightsail and WordPress itself. However, I found that due to my familiarity with Joomla a similar CMS platform, although not exactly the same I didn't heavily rely on external resources. Instead, I chose to dive directly into practical experimentation, confident that the process would be relatively straightforward. The only exception was consulting the WordPress website occasionally for specific guidance on certain tasks.

   - **Insight:** Self-reliance and confidence: I feel like now I can figure things out for myself sometimes without having to watch tutorials or read documentation before trying to work.
   - **Insight:** Transferable skills: By learning another CMS (Joomla) before WordPress, it gives me some skills and knowledge that I can apply to another CMS (WordPress).
   - **Insight:** Targeted Learning: By looking up documentation on specific things that I was stuck on really streamed line the process.
