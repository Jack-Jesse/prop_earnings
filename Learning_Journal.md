# Learning Journal - Week 2

## Learning Activities & Resources
1. **Learning Resource:** Started with watching videos on Linkedin Learning. I tried watching a video on Wordpress and then watching video about Joomla on Linkedin Learning. After trying Linkedin Learning, I started doing some research on google. After researching I used the AWS Lightsail and Joomla provided docs and resources. I found a site called infra.engineer and I also used my IT subject as a resource.

    - *Link to Resource:* [Linkedin Learning Joomla]([https://www.linkedin.com/learning/joomla-4-essential-training/installing-joomla-4?u=2223545)
    - *Link to Resource:* [Linkedin Learning WordPress]([https://www.linkedin.com/learning/wordpress-5-essential-training/the-admin-panel?u=2223545)
    - *Link to Resource:* [AWS Lightsail Joomla](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lightsail/latest/userguide/amazon-lightsail-quick-start-guide-joomla.html)
    - *Link to Resource:* [Joomla Docs](https://docs.joomla.org)
  
2. **Learning Activity:** I watched videos on Linkedin Learning, then read through the docs and resources in the provided links. I followed these step by step.
   - **Insight:** Practical Application: This is important to actually learn something or to actually learn how to do something. Such as, applying the learned knowledge.
   - **Insight:** Self-Directed Learning: This is important because I feel that a student or anyone learning something can decide the best way for them to learn. For example, during this prac I realised although watching videos can be helpful, I felt that is was better for me to read through something and to follow it step by step. It was easier for me to keep track and to then research from that step if I get stuck.
   - **Insight:** Resource Evaluation: Evaluating resources and making sure they are trusted and the most up to date information is important because it can save on a lot if time and potential confusion.
   - **Insight:** Integration of Prior Knowledge: This is really useful, it can save so much time when you remeber how to do something that you have previously learned.

## Estimated Hours: 8 hours

## Content Insights
Insight from the content is that I can see the benefits of using a CMS some circumstanses, specifically it may be more useful to use a CMS if you need a dynamic website or a website with a database. I can see that a CMS can make a lot of things easier.

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights
Exploring content management systems has opened my eyes to what it could be like performing these tasks when I get employed. I also have the confidence to perform these tasks as a professional IT employee now. I feel that I can get employed and learn things on my own if I do not already know. I really think self directed learning is important as a professional IT worker.
