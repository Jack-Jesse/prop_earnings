# Learning Journal - Week 5

## Learning Activities & Resources
1. **Learning Resource:** My primary learning goal for this week was to learn child themes through video tutorials. Throughout the process of trying to use child themes, I encountered significant challenges in implementing them effectively. Because of these challenges I conducted additional research by exploring written tutorials and reading the WordPress documentation to supplement my understanding.

2. **Learning Activity:** I first watched video tutorials to learn about child themes and how to use them. The video tutorials I watched were not enough, so I read through some written tutorials and documentation. Part of my learning is doing something, so as soon as I watched the video tutorial and lecture video, I jumped straight in to trying to use child themes. When I got stuck, I would then research and read through documentation from WordPress and read other written tutorials. 
   - **Insight:** Importance of Documentation: I am realising now how important documentation is, especially when it is written well and when it is up to date. As I move forward through learning experiences, such as learning CMSs and child themes, I've come to appreciate how well-written documentation serves as a perfect informative go to source for guidance. 
   - **Insight:** Understanding Theme Hierarchy: It is important to understand child themes and how to use them in WordPress. Child themes allow web developers to make modifications without affecting the original theme. Using child themes helps keep our customisations active.

## Content Insights
Following best practices ensures everything is running smoothly. I don't want to be editing my WordPress website with custom code and customising the appearance just for it to possibly disappear when an update comes out.  

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights
I have been gaining valuable documentation skills throughout this process of learning CMSs. Learning documentation is important for employability. It doesn't only help with learning new technologies, but it also helps with collaboration and working in a team effectively. Learning about child themes really shows the importance of following best practices. Using child themes and following best practices makes sure my work is quality and instills confidence in clients and employers.
